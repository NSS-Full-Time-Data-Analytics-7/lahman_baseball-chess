-- ## Lahman Baseball Database Exercise
-- - this data has been made available [online](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) by Sean Lahman
-- - you can find a data dictionary [here](http://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2016.txt)

-- ### Use SQL queries to find answers to the *Initial Questions*. If time permits, choose one (or more) of the *Open-Ended Questions*.
-- Toward the end of the bootcamp, we will revisit this data if time allows to combine SQL, Excel Power Pivot, and/or Python to answer
-- more of the *Open-Ended Questions*.



-- **Initial Questions**

-- 1. What range of years for baseball games played does the provided database cover? 



-- 2. Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for
-- which he played?
   
   

-- 3. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each player’s first and last names
-- as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned.
-- Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?  David Price

SELECT DISTINCT(CONCAT(namefirst, ' ' ,namelast)) as name, schoolname, SUM(salary::numeric::money) AS salary

-- 4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield",
-- those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number
-- of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.
   
   
   
-- 5. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places.
-- Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?

-- 6. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where __success__ is measured as the percentage of

-- **Open-ended questions**

-- 11. Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 2000 and later to answer this question.
-- As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look
-- on a year-by-year basis.

-- 12. In this question, you will explore the connection between number of wins and attendance.
--     <ol type="a">
--       <li>Does there appear to be any correlation between attendance at home games and number of wins? </li>
--       <li>Do teams that win the world series see a boost in attendance the following year? What about teams that made the playoffs?
-- 	  Making the playoffs means either being a division winner or a wild card winner.</li>
--     </ol>


-- 13. It is thought that since left-handed pitchers are more rare, causing batters to face them less often, that they are more effective.
-- Investigate this claim and present evidence to either support or dispute this claim. First, determine just how rare left-handed pitchers
-- are compared with right-handed pitchers. Are left-handed pitchers more likely to win the Cy Young Award? Are they more likely to make it
-- into the hall of fame?
