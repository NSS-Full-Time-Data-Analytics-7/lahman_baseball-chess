-- 7a. From 1970 – 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series?

SELECT teamid, yearid, w, wswin

      AND wswin = 'N'
ORDER BY w DESC
LIMIT 1;
--7a. answer: SEA 201 116 wins and no world series win


--7b. What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? Doing this will probably
--    result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion – determine why this is the case.

SELECT teamid, yearid, w, wswin

--7b. answer: LAN 1981 63 wins and world series win

/* In 1981 there was a strike from june 12- july-31 over free agent compensation resulting in the season being cut in half 
and several teams missing out on playoff berths
